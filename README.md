# Contrail In Action

This project is a growing and structured tutorial made by and for **real Contrail users**.

If you are curious to know what happens exactly when you create a Virtual Network, or when two VMs talk to each other, you came to the right place. We go through all levels of detail, from snorkeling to deep dive.

To get started, just browse the [Wiki](https://github.com/virtualhops/Contrail-Inside-Out/wiki)

Contributors please keep it structured, no random growth! Get to the point, and avoid long command output :)
