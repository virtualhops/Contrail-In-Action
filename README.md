# Contrail In Action

This project is a growing and structured tutorial made by and for **real Contrail users**.

If you are curious to know what happens exactly when you create a new VM interface, or when two VMs in the same or different regions talk to each other, you came to the right place.

Just browse the [Wiki](https://github.com/virtualhops/Contrail-Inside-Out/wiki)
